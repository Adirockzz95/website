{{< spaces 50 >}}Hey there! Aditya this side.

{{< image "profile.jpg" "My photo">}}

This site is a place where I keep my notes, drawings, and things I’ve made along the way.
It’s a bit of an everything-goes-here record that helps me slow down and think.When I’m not at my desk, I’m usually tinkering.
That might mean an embedded project, or it might mean working on the house.

Either way, I tend to get preoccupied with the logistics of my living space,
from figuring out how to maintain that god damn fridge to constantly rethinking the best setup for my home lab and how it fits alongside bookshelfs and wardrobes.

If you want to get in touch, email is probably the best way: **_khandkar[dot]adi[at]gmail.com_**
